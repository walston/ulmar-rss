# Audio notes for The Last Throne of Ulmar

Ulmar is a D&D homebrew campaign I run; this repository builds & maintains the audio-notes I keep as a podcast for my personal workflow.

## Local Setup

1. `npm run setup-local` to copy the prerequisite scripts.
2. edit `.env` after setup to point `$HOST` to the podcast host url & `$PATH_TO_AUDIO_STORAGE` to the appropriate path on `$HOST`.

## Host Setup

1. `npm run setup-post-receive` to copy the post-receive script
