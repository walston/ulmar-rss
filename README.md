# Audio notes for The Last Throne of Ulmar

Ulmar is a D&D homebrew campaign I run; this repository builds & maintains the audio-notes I keep as a podcast for my personal workflow.

## Local Setup

1. `npm run setup` to copy the prerequisite scripts.
2. edit `.env` after setup to point `$HOST` as a `user@domain` & `$SERVER_PATH` to the appropriate path on `$HOST`.
